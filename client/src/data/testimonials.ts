Despite garnering interest from several dentists, it proved to be a daunting task. Additionally, my need for orthopedic surgery necessitated the hiring of a dentist to fill in for a six-month period during my recovery. It was during this time that we were introduced to Dental Strategies by one of the bankers assisting us. Michael promptly met with us and initiated the process. Within just two months, we were introduced to a prospective buyer. Working with someone like Michael, who is not only a former dentist but also possesses expertise that surpasses that of a traditional real estate broker, proved to be advantageous for us. His knowledge in the field allowed us to navigate through the complexities of selling our dental practice with confidence. The assistance provided by attorney Mike Treppa, and Dental Strategies played a crucial role in successfully selling our dental practice. Their expertise and guidance not only facilitated the process but also ensured that we received an offer that truly reflected the value of our well-established family practice.`,

It requires careful planning, hard work, and the right guidance to navigate through the complex process of purchasing a dental clinic. I have always dreamed of owning my own dental practice, but I was unsure of where to begin. I attended numerous seminars and scoured online listings for dental practices on sale, but I struggled to find a clinic that met my expectations. I was overwhelmed by the amount of work and the steps required to make this dream a reality. For instance, I had no idea which attorney or lender to use, and I felt lost in the sea of information. It was during this uncertain period that I connected with Michael. He proved to be a tremendous asset, guiding me through the entire process of purchasing a dental clinic. He patiently answered all of my questions and went above and beyond to help me every step of the way. With his expertise and guidance, I was able to find a clinic that not only met my needs but exceeded my expectations. The transfer of ownership was not without its challenges, but Michael was by my side every step of the way. He fostered a positive relationship between myself and the selling dentist, ensuring a smooth and successful transition. Thanks to Michael's help, I was able to retain a highly experienced team and continue to grow this beautiful dental practice.

His goal was to create a win win situation matching a seller to the right buyer. Michael gave me hope, asked for my trust, and within 2 months introduced me to a terrific person, fine dentist, and a great match for my practice.
